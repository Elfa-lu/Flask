In this project, I build a <b>book review website</b>.  
(1) Users will be able to <b>register</b> for the website and then <b>log in</b> using their username and password.  
(2) Once they log in, they will be able to <b>search for books</b>, <b>leave reviews</b> for individual books, and <b>see the reviews</b> made by other people.  
(3) I also use the a <b>third-party API</b> by Goodreads, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience.  
(4) Finally, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via <b>my websiteâ€™s API</b>.
